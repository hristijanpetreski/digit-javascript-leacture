# digit-javascript-lecture
This repository contains examples and presentation assets. Check the presentation folder if you are interested in the contents. I was presenting the contents and the code examples during the Digit event. The idea for this presentation is to outline some of the newer JavaScript features and explain some differences between var, let, and functions.
